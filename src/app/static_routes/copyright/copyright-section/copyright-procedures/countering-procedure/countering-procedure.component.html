<h3>Procedure to Supply a Counter-Notice to the Designated Agent:</h3>
<p>
If the content provider, member or user believes that the material that was 
removed or to which access was disabled is either not infringing, or the content 
provider, member or user believes that it has the right to post and use such 
material from the owner of the intellectual property, the owner's agent, or 
pursuant to the law, the content provider, member or user must send a 
counter-notice containing the following information to the Designated Agent 
listed below:
</p>
<ol>
    <li>
    A physical or electronic signature of the content provider, member or user;
    </li>
    <li>
    Identification of the material that has been removed or to which access to 
    has been disabled and the location at which the material appeared before it 
    was removed or disabled;
    </li>
    <li>
    A statement that the content provider, member or user has a good faith 
    belief that the material was removed or disabled as a result of mistake or 
    a misidentification of the material; and
    </li>
    <li>
    Content provider's, member's or user's name, address, telephone number, and, 
    if available, e-mail address and a statement that such person or entity 
    consents to the jurisdiction of the Federal Court for the judicial district 
    in which the content provider's, member's or user's address is located, or 
    if the content provider's, member's or user's address is located outside the 
    United States, for any judicial district in which Company is located, and 
    that such person or entity will accept service of process from the person 
    who provided notification of the alleged infringement.
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
If a counter-notice is received by the Designated Agent, Company may send a copy 
of the counter-notice to the original complaining party informing that person 
that Company may replace the removed material or cease disabling it in 10 
business days.  Unless the owner files an action seeking a court order against 
the content provider, member or user, the removed material may be replaced or 
access to it restored in 10 to 14 business days or more after receipt of the 
counter-notice, at Company's discretion.
